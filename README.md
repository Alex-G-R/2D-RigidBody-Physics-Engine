# 2D RigidBody Physics Engine 🚀

This is a simple 2D Physics engine, built by me.

## Features ✨

- Fully intact rigid bodies ✅
- Semi-optimised renderer ✅
- Won't blow up your pc ❓

## Installation & Usage 🛠️

### Compiling
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/{Alex-G-R}/{2D-RigidBody-Physics-Engine}`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd 2D-RigidBody-Physics-Engine`.
3. Spin up mingw or other compiler of your choice
4. And there you go: <br>
` g++ -c src/*.cpp -std=c++14 -m64 -g -Wall -I include && g++ *.o -o bin/debug/main -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image && ./bin/debug/main `

## Technologies Used 🛠️
